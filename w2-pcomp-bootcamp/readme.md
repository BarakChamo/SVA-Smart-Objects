### What is Physical Computing?
Physical computing is the creation of computer systems that interact with the physical world and physical body.
It provides tools that bridge the analog and digital worlds. From
the inputs of sensors to environment to outputting light, sound, and/or motion,
interaction becomes possible, and through coding, endlessly customizable. 

Using microcontrollers, sensors, and actuators we will study the principles
of tangible systems, embodied HCI and protoypes new forms of interactive systems.

Physical computing skills will serve you well as you venture off to prototype, design and build
smart objects, interactive installations, robots or any product with a computer in it.

### Electronics fundamentals

All physical computing project are, essentially, small computers that interact with
custom circuits, be it as simple as an Arduino detecting button clicks and lighting up
an LED or a WiFi-enabled controller that senses temperature and moisture levels and 
alerts you to water your basil in time.

Before we get to the computing part (by programmming microcontrollers) it's important
to get a good grasp on the physical, or electrical side of things.


### Hello Arduino
Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output.

Arduino simplifies the process of working with microcontrollers by offering a unified environment for a a range of boards, sensors, and compatible hardware - that means that you don't have to dig through long data sheets, run command line compilers, etc. The Arduino community is both vibrant and helpful and many projects, from controlling programmable LEDs to a plethora of sensors, are available and well documented.

To use Arduino install the [Arduino Development Enviroment](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) for your operating system and follow this [AdaFruit guide to set up your Feather board in the Arduino board manager](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-huzzah32-esp32-feather/using-with-arduino-ide).
